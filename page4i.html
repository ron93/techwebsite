            <h3>PS5 Release Date:</h3>

            <p>We all know it's coming, but no one seems to know exactly when. We have done the hard work for you and figured it out. Sony is a creature of habit fellow gamers, as are we all. All it takes is some mathematics and an ear to the ground of the gaming industry to start piecing together this crucial part of the puzzle. Join us on our PS5 release date page to see what these factors have revealed thus far. Check back often because we are constantly updating the page with our latest findings!</p>

            <h3>Specs: A Glimpse under the Hood</h3>

            <p>You thought trying to predict the PS5 release date was hard? We're tackling something much more difficult next. As we all know, technology evolves and changes in limitless ways with each passing year. Trying to nail down the exact path it will take is like trying to find a grain of salt on a beach. That being said, there are patterns, predictions, and signs that we can use to illuminate the path. </p>

            <h3>Price: How High Can it Go?</h3>

            <p>The Price of a console is always a touchy subject. When it comes to the PS5, the latest rumors are showing that the console may come in two versions which could drastically affect the price of the system. The price of the PS4 showed that $400 is a price point that works, so it's doubtful that Sony will go any higher, if at all, with the PS5. </p>

            <h3>PS5 Design: Artist's Renditions</h3>

            <p>I am a master of words, but I harbor a deep respect for those who can bring images to life. We don't know for certain what the PS5 will look like, but that offers us the unique ability to consider a multitude of options. Will it be a box, will it be cloud-based, who knows? There are signs that point to something completely different than anything else we've seen, but that only fuels our imaginations. </p>
