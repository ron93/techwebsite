        <h1>A SMARTPHONE TO KEEP THE ELDERLY SAFE</h1>
        <article>
            <p>Though senior citizens are generally less fascinated than younger generations with the bells and whistles of mobile devices, they could soon find themselves relying on a new smartphone app built by Rutgers students to help them avoid falling.</p>

            <p>Falls are the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal injuries for older Americans, according to the National Council on Aging. Problems with balance make adults over 65 particularly susceptible, says Deanna Gray-Miceli, assistant professor in the Division of Nursing Science at Rutgers' School of Nursing, who has studied the vulnerabilities of the elderly for more than 30 years.</p>

            <p>In search of a way to reduce seniors' rate of falling, Gray-Mipceli collaborated with William Craelius, a bioengineering professor at Rutgers' School of Engineering, to create a tool that would assess balance during daily living activities, such as standing up, sitting down and walking.
                <br> Under Craelius's supervison, students programmed an app, developed by visiting professor Nicki Newby, that used sensors in a strapped-on smartphone to measure body movements like sway, jerkiness or acceleration, which can trigger loss of balance. The app detects the rate of changes in movements using a gyroscope, part of the smartphone technology.</p>

            <p>The researchers found that isolating movement patterns immediately before a change in balance could help predict when a person is about to fall.
                <br> "What I love about this type of application is that it is objective – and the data never lie," Craelius says. "It should allow us to establish a baseline for patterns of movement and a repository of readings that we can easily manage in a database."</p>

            <p>To test the app, students strapped two smartphones to the sternums and lower backs of six individuals ranging in age from 76 to 94. Their blood pressure – changes in which can be associated with loss of balance and falls – was taken before and after participants stood up and sat down several times.</p>

            <p>The app recorded sway movements and acceleration of motion, which, along with the blood pressure readings, will contribute to a baseline database to help Gray-Miceli build a predictive model of falling.
                <br> "This will help us better understand the mechanisms involved when people lose their balance and allow us to intervene to avoid people putting themselves in those situations," Gray-Miceli says.</p>

            <p>The next stage of the research will involve getting a better understanding of when and where risky movements occur.</p>

            <p>According to Gray-Miceli, who has served as the New Jersey co-representative of the National Council of Aging Falls Free Task Force, one-third of all seniors who live in a conventional household and 1.43 million people who reside in long-term care facilities experience falls annually.
                <br> "This is an exciting step forward in helping us protect people who we worry about from falling and injuring themselves," Gray-Miceli says.</p>
